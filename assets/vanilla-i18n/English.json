Initially trained in art history, I am co-supervising the Master 2 \"Documentation et Humanit\u00e9s Num\u00e9riques\" at the Ecole du Louvre, where I teach methodological and technical courses. As a R&D engineer for ALMAnaCH, I contributed to various projects : TIMEUS (ANR), LECTAUREP, or else DAHN.","thibault":"I am the head of the MA \"Digital Technologies Applied to History\" (Technologies Num\u00e9riques Appliqu\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019Histoire) at the \u00c9cole Nationale des Chartes (Paris, France). I am a classicist who served as an engineer both at the Centre for eResearch (Kings College London, UK) and the Humboldt Chair for Digital Humanities (Leipzig, Germany) where I developed the data backbone of the future Perseus 5 (under the CapiTainS.org project). I am a founding member of the Technical Committee for the Distributed Text Services standard ( w3id.org/dts ). The major part of my teaching is dedicated to patrimonial data engineering, namely digital data management, development good practices, standards for communication and programming languages. My research mainly focus on automatically processing ancient languages through deep learning and the distribution of corpora."},"footer":{"team":"Who are the people behind HTR-United?"},"main":{"desc":{"main":"HTR-United is a Github organization without any other form of legal personality.
